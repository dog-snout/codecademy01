  <h1>Mark Barnes:  Portfolio</h1>
  
  <p>Hi! I am Mark Barnes: Delaware creative, animation hobbyist, and graphic design free agent currently working on call with The Melini Group.
   <br>
     Professionally, I previously made a home in advertising and content marketing but I also have experience in branding and web design. In addition, my current side projects are a Codecademy front-end engineering course and self-teaching Figma.
   <br>
     The page you are currently viewing is a carefully condensed version of my design portfolio that serves as both practice and demonstration for what Iâ€™ve learned on Codecademy and mapped out while trying Figma for the first time.
   <br>
     You can view my full up-to-date portfolio here.</p>
